	 The Company class has the following properties
		name
		numberOfEmployees
		revenue
		expenses
	 	companySize * 
	 	profit **	 

	 Please select an appropriate data type, and write a getter and setter for each property listed above. 
	 Note, some properties may or may not require both a getter and a setter.
	 
	 Use the main method in PersonTest.java to verify the functionality of the Person class.  
	 (Please see notes in PersonTest.java for further instructions.)
	 
	  * companySize is derived (i.e. calculated), and does not need a setter. A company is "small" if less than 50 employees,
	  	"medium" if between 51 and 250 employees, "large" if greater than 250 employees.
	  	
	 ** profit is derived (i.e. calculated), and does not need a setter. Profit equals revenue minus expenses.
