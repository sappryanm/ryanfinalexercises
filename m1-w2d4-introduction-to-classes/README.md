#Introduction to Classes Exercises

Introduction to Classes contains a series of exercises which require you to define and test Java classes of increasing difficulty.  The series is grouped into three sets: Easy, Medium, and Difficult.

A starter Eclipse project containig all the class and test source files you'll need has been created for you.

### Easy

For each of the classes listed below, write a Java class that has "getter" and "setter" methods for each of the defined properties. Detailed descriptions of the properties, and further instructions are provided in the individual source code files. ***Don't forget to verify the classes you create using the associated test classes.*** *(See the instructions in the source files.)*

* com.techelevator.product.Product
* com.techelevator.person.Person
* com.techelevator.company.Company

### Medium

For each of the classes listed below, write a Java class that implements the methods defined by the class. Note, you may need to create properties to fully implement some of the methods.  Detailed descriptions of the methods, and further instructions are provided in the individual source code files. ***Don't forget to verify the classes you create using the associated test classes.*** *(See the instructions in the source files.)*

* com.techelevator.dog.Dog
* com.techelevator.shoppingcart.ShoppingCart
* com.techelevator.swtch.Switch *("swtch" missspelling in package name is intentional)*

### Difficult

This set contains only one class, Calculator, which as the name implies, represents a calculator class. It implements a basic calculator with limit functionality. It can add, substract, multiply, and raise to a power, and supports a single running result, that can be cleared (reset). The challenge in this exercise is in number of methods, and the interplay between them and the properties, rather than in technical difficulty.

* com.techelevator.calculator.Calculator
