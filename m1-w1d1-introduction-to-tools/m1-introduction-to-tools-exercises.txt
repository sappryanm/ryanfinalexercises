Introduction to Tools Exercises
-------------------------------

The following exercises cover the command line, and Git.

Your instructor will have helped you clone the m1-java-intro-to-tools-exercises repository from BitBucket to your home directory on your laptop. In additon, they will have told you about the "playground", and instructed you to open this file.

Getting to the Playground
-------------------------

The first step is to open your shell, and make sure you are in the playground.

$ cd ~/m1-java-intro-to-tools-exercises
$ pwd
/Users/<your-name>m1-introduction-to-tools-exercises

Once you have confirmed you are in the playground, you may proceed with the exercises. 

If you are having trouble finding the playground, please ask another student to review your steps. A second pair of eyes is one of the best debugging tools a programmer has. If you are still unable to enter the playground, please see one of the instructors.

Exercises
---------

Type, or copy-and-paste your answers immediately below the questions.  When you are done, you will need to create a Git Pull Request in order to submit your work. One of the instructors will then review your answers.

1.  What does the ~ (tilde) character in the `cd ~/m1-introduction-to-tools-exercises` command from above refer to?
Tilde always represents your home directory.

2.  What is your current directory location?
/Users/rsapp/Development/workspaces/ryansapp-java-exercises/m1-w1d1-introduction-to-tools

3.  Display a list of all the files and folders, including the dot-files-and-folders, in your current directory locaton.
.					m1-introduction-to-tools-exercises.txt
..					pagila.sql
java-helloworld
4.  What are the names of the files, including any dot-files, from Question 3?
files are 
-rw-r--r--@ 1 rsapp  staff     5664 Sep 12 14:29 m1-introduction-to-tools-exercises.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 rsapp  staff  2976426 Sep 12 13:48 pagila.sql
5.  What the the names of the folders, including any dot-folders, from Question 3?
folders 
drwxr-xr-x  5 rsapp  staff      170 Sep 12 13:48 .
drwxr-xr-x  7 rsapp  staff      238 Sep 12 14:12 ..
drwxr-xr-x  4 rsapp  staff      136 Sep 12 13:48 java-helloworld

6.  What are dot-files-and-folders?
. represents hidden files or system files
. Folder means current directory   .. Means going back one level
7.  The `less` utility is commonly used to read-only view the contents of files. 
    To use, simply enter `less <file-name>`. 
    You may PageUp, PageDown, and search within `less`. Press Q to quit. Press H for additional help.
    Try:
    $ less pagila.sql
   
    What are the last three lines in pagila.sql?
	--
	-- PostgreSQL database dump complete
	--
	
	
    (While an extremely large number of spacebars, or even worse, returns, will eventually get you to the bottom of the file, see if you can find another way to get to the end with a single keystroke. Hint: Look in additinal help.)
    
8.  Another useful read-only utility is `cat` which streams the contents of the file. 
    It is commonly connected to some other utility such as `sort` or `grep` using a pipe.
    Try:
    $ cat pagila.sql
    
    What happened?
	Cat streamed the program all the way to the end of the code
    
9.  `grep` is a work horse utility that is used to search the contents of files.
    It is commonly connected via a pipe to another utility which streams file contents to it.
    To use, simply enter `grep -i <word-to-search>`.  The -i tells `grep` to ignore case.
    Try:
    $ cat pagila.sql | grep -i ohio
    
    What was displayed?
	299	32 Pudukkottai Lane		Ohio	140	38834	967274728547	2006-02-15 09:45:30
	484	98 Pyongyang Boulevard		Ohio	11	88749	191958435142	2006-02-15 09:45:30
	3807	Columbus	USA	Ohio	711470
	3825	Cleveland	USA	Ohio	478403
	3846	Cincinnati	USA	Ohio	331285
	3848	Toledo	USA	Ohio	313619
	3873	Akron	USA	Ohio	217074
	3916	Dayton	USA	Ohio	166179
    Try:
    $ cat pagila.sql | grep -i 'buenos aires'      ### Quotes are needed because of the embedded space.
    
    Did grep find "Buenos Aires" in the file (Yes/No)?
	Yes
    
    Try:
    $ cat pagila.sql | grep -i horse
    
    Did grep find any occurances of "horse" (Yes/No)?
	no

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are strongly encouraged to make `less`, `cat | grep`, and the undiscussed, `find -exec grep` (look it up) a part of your regular commannd line toolkit.

10. java-helloworld contains a representation of a simple Helloworld Eclipse project.  
    Change directory into java-helloworld, and list all its files and folders.
drwxr-xr-x  4 rsapp  staff   136 Sep 12 13:48 .
drwxr-xr-x  5 rsapp  staff   170 Sep 12 13:48 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 rsapp  staff  1091 Sep 12 13:48 pom.xml
drwxr-xr-x  4 rsapp  staff   136 Sep 12 13:48 src


11. pom.xml is a Maven build file. You will learn more about this file later in the module.  
    View the file with less.
	
	
    
12. Change into src/main/java/com/techelevator directory under java-helloworld.

    Show your current working directory. 
/Users/rsapp/Development/workspaces/ryansapp-java-exercises/m1-w1d1-introduction-to-tools/java-helloworld/src/main/java/com/techelevator

    List all its files and folders in current working directory.
	drwxr-xr-x  3 rsapp  staff  102 Sep 12 13:48 .
	drwxr-xr-x  3 rsapp  staff  102 Sep 12 13:48 ..
	-rw-r--r--  1 rsapp  staff  141 Sep 12 13:48 Helloworld.java
	
	
13. "Helloworld.java" is the sole source code file of the Helloworld application.
    Make a backup of the file named "Helloworld.java.backup"
    
    Show the command(s) you used.
    cp Helloworld.java Helloworld.java.backup
    List all the files and folders in the src/main/java/com/techelevator directory after the backup has been made.

    drwxr-xr-x  4 rsapp  staff  136 Sep 12 14:44 .

-rw-r--r--  1 rsapp  staff  141 Sep 12 13:48 Helloworld.java
-rw-r--r--  1 rsapp  staff  141 Sep 12 14:44 Helloworld.java.copy

14. Rename "Helloworld.java.backup" to "Helloworld.java.copy"

    Show the command(s) you used.
    mv Helloworld.java.backup Helloworld.java.copy
    List all the files and folders in the src/main/java/com/techelevator directory after the file was renamed.
    
15. Remove the backup file, "Helloworld.java.copy"

    Show the command(s) you used.
	
	rm Helloworld.java.backup
    
    List all the files and folders in the src/main/java/com/techelevator directory after removing the backup.
	drwxr-xr-x  3 rsapp  staff  102 Sep 12 14:52 .

	-rw-r--r--  1 rsapp  staff  141 Sep 12 13:48 Helloworld.java
16. Once you are completed, navigate to the root playground direct "/Users/<your-name>/workspaces/m1-java-intro-to-tools-exercises" and stage files in git.
	You will use "git add ." to stage any unstaged files.
	
17. Use the "git status" command to check for any files that have not been staged. If there aren't any, then you can commit with git commit -m "My first Git Commit"
