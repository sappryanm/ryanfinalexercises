# JQuery Library Introduction Exercises

For these jQuery exercises you will be able to practice traversing the DOM and manipulating the elements.

For exercises focused on *finding or filtering* elements, you can write the element out to the console. For example

```javascript
//Find the parent of the "sports" section
var sportsSection = $("sports").parent();
console.log(sportsSection);
```

1. Find the children of the "recipes" section.

2. Find the "titles" of "beef" recipes. 

3. Find the children of the "blackened-catfish" recipe.

4. Find the parent of the "winter-fruit-salad" recipe.
 
5. Find the parents of the "curried-tilapia" recipe.

6. Find the siblings of "tailgate-chili" "made-it".
      
7. Find the siblings of "vegetarian" recipes.

8. Filter even items from the table-of-contents list.

9. Filter "made-it" checkbox from "black-bean-burrito" children.

10. Get the text for all h3 elements.

11. Set the text for the "cabbage-pie" title to "Homemade Cabbage Pie -- Yum!".

12. Set the html for the "cabbage-pie" title to `"Homemade Cabbage Pie<br/>Yum!"`.

13. Now for good measure, and to seal in the difference between text() and html(), set the text for the "cabbage-pie" title to `"Homemade Cabbage Pie<br>Yum!"`.

14. Add "Delicious recipe description and instructions go here." to all recipe introductory paragraphs.

15. Get input type of all "remarks".

16. Set input type to "text" for all "remarks".
